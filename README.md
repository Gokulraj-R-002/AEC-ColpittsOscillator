# AEC-ColpittsOscillator
This repo contains the simulation files and a [report](https://github.com/Gokulraj-R-002/AEC-ColpittsOscillator/blob/main/Simulation_Report.pdf) for the implementation of Colpitts Oscillator.

To view the circuits, open the `.asc` files in [LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html).

After the simulation results, the circuit was implemented using hardware and its output was verified.
